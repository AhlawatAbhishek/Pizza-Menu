# Fast React Pizza Co. 🍕

Welcome to the **Fast React Pizza Co.** project! This is a React-based web application for a fictional pizza company. The project demonstrates various React concepts and best practices, including props, conditional rendering, rendering multiple components using JavaScript's `map` method, and handling asynchronous operations.

## Features

- 📦 **Props Passing**: Data is passed from the root component to child components using props, ensuring a unidirectional data flow.
- 🔄 **Conditional Rendering**: Components are conditionally rendered based on the application's state, providing a dynamic user experience.
- 🗺️ **Rendering Multiple Components**: The application renders multiple pizza components dynamically using JavaScript's `map` method.
- ⚛️ **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage component state.
- 🌐 **Side Effects**: Uses React's `useEffect` hook to handle side effects, such as fetching data from an API.
- 🔍 **Fetch API**: Fetches data from an external API and handles asynchronous operations using `.then` and `.catch`.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features and syntax.
- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling the application.
